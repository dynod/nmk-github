# Configuration Extension

As for all **`nmk`** projects config items, [**`nmk-github`** ones](config.md) are all overridable by other plug-ins and project files. But the ones described on this page are specifically designed to be extended.

## Actions

Plugins and/or project may want to configure the generated Github workflow file. The following items may be extended for this purpose:

* **{ref}`${githubPythonVersions}<githubPythonVersions>`**: List of python versions on which to parallelize Github action jobs.
  Example:
  ```yaml
  githubPythonVersions:
      - 3.10
  ```
* **{ref}`${githubBuildSteps}<githubBuildSteps>`**: List of extra build steps to be performed on branch push, after standard **`nmk`** build.
  Example:
  ```yaml
  githubBuildSteps:
      - name: Sample step
        run: echo hello world
  ```
* **{ref}`${githubPublishSteps}<githubPublishSteps>`**: List of extra build steps to be performed on tag push, after standard **`nmk`** build.
  Example:
  ```yaml
  githubPublishSteps:
      - name: Sample step
        run: echo hello world
  ```

## Badges

Badges generated by **`nmk-github`** plugin can be configured with the following items:

* **{ref}`${githubLicense}<githubLicense>`**: License for current project
  Example:
  ```yaml
  githubLicense: GPL
  ```
* **{ref}`${githubIssuesRepo}<githubIssuesRepo>`**: Github repository (of the same Github user) holding the issues for the current project. This can be usefull when you want to centralize your Github issues in a single repository rather than letting each project holding them.
  Example:
  ```yaml
  githubIssuesRepo: another-project
  ```
* **{ref}`${githubIssuesLabel}<githubIssuesLabel>`**: Extra label for issues query badge
  Example:
  ```yaml
  githubIssuesLabel: "component:${githubRepo}"
  ```
